    <h1>Art!</h1>
    <p>I <strong>really <em>love</em></strong> art! I discovered my love of art from a young age and have followed my passion ever since. That's how I came to have a double major in studio art and computer science. This semester I am also taking a senior seminar class in art. The goal is to develop a body of work that is largely self directed. My idea is to create a series of pieces focused around the passage of time. This was inspired by Claude Monet's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haystacks_(Monet_series)" title="Claude Monet's Haystacks Series" target="_blank"> <em>Haystacks</em> series</a>. And here is an image of one of my pieces that will be part of my series.<img src="dawn.png" alt="Early Sunrise over a Mountainscape" /> </p>
